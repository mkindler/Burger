# Burger üçî

## Description

This project utilizes `MySQL`, `Node`, `Express`, `Handlebars`, and an `ORM` to create an application that allows users to order burgers of their choice üçî, view their orders, devour their selections, and clean-up after eating. üòÑ

## Task

This application is deployed to and hosted by Heroku. A user could also fork the repository, install required npm dependencies, create the necessary database, and run the application on their local machine and localhost.

## Usage

This application can be used by anyone who would like a basic and fun application to create, "use", and delete data. Applications like this are a great model for understanding how the technologies included are used, and for understanding how to build similar applications.

## Installation

If users are interested in running this application locally, they will need to install required npm dependencies, including:

- npm init
- npm install express
- npm install express-handlebars
- npm install mysql

Once the appropriate dependencies have been installed, users can run the application from the CLI using `node server.js`.

Additionally, if users are interested in deploying their own version of the application to Heroku, they must follow appropriate guidelines for Heroku deployment, which includes utilizing the JawsDB add-on and editing their connection.js file as needed.

## Process

This project was designed by referencing several other previous activities and projects, as well as the guide provided for creating this project.

## Deployed Application

This application has been deployed and is live on Heroku: https://blooming-chamber-90463.herokuapp.com/
